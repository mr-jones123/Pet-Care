# MediPet 
This is a program made by developers of **FEU Tech**, lead by Xynil 'mr-jones123' Lacap. Its purpose is to make pet treatments easier for people by making navigation of pet care shops easier. This was done thanks to the intuitive graph algorithms that was used in this program. The development of this command-line based program is based on Graph Theory in Computer Science. 
## Things to Remember

The program is written in **Java**, so contributing to this project will be easier for Java developers.
